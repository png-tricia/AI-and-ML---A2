## PROG25211 AI and ML - Python: Assignment 2
Program: **Computer Programming @ Sheridan College** <br>
Note: The following assignment was completed during Semester 3 (2024) <br>

## The Task: 
Build a trained algorithm that can be used with a Restful Web Service (Postman). 

## The Details: 
There are two jupyter notebooks: <br>
<ul>
  <li>The first part walks you through steps 1 to 5 - cleaning up the dataset and Restful Web Service setup.</li>
  <li>The second part walks you through step 6 which was consuming the web service. Here we provided images for numerous evaluations.</li>
</ul>

## Thoughts/Comments: 
It was fun playing with the algorithm and receiving different inputs.
